## [0.16.1] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Docker support for local test execution
  - Added `Dockerfile` with Ubuntu 22.04 and all build dependencies
  - Added `docker-test.sh` helper script for running test suite

- Valgrind memory leak testing support
  - Added `Dockerfile.valgrind` for running tests under valgrind
  - Added `docker-valgrind.sh` script for easy leak checking
  - Added `tests/gstd.supp` suppression file for GStreamer/GLib known allocations
  - Usage: `./docker-valgrind.sh` (all tests) or `./docker-valgrind.sh test_name`

### Fixed
- **Build error: Incomplete type access in HTTP handler** (`gstd_http.c`)
  - Added `gstd_pipeline_get_element()` accessor function to `gstd_pipeline.h`
  - Replaced direct struct field access with accessor for proper encapsulation
  - Fixes compilation with libsoup 3.0.x

- **Build warning: Incorrect libsoup version checks** (`gstd_http.c`)
  - Fixed version macro usage for `soup_server_message_set_status()` (needs 3.0.0)
  - Fixed version macro usage for `soup_server_message_unpause()` (needs 3.2.0)
  - Properly handles libsoup 3.0.x which has different API than 3.2.x

- **Thread safety: State refcount race condition** (`gstd_state.c`)
  - Added `GST_OBJECT_LOCK/UNLOCK` around refcount operations
  - Matches thread-safe pattern used in `gstd_pipeline.c`

- **Bug: CORS headers not set on HTTP responses** (`gstd_http.c`)
  - Fixed `soup_server_message_get_request_headers()` → `soup_server_message_get_response_headers()`
  - CORS headers were being appended to wrong header collection in libsoup 3.0+

- **Memory leak: Session property setter** (`gstd_session.c`)
  - Added `g_object_unref()` for previous value before setting new pipelines/debug objects
  - Prevents leak when properties are set multiple times

- **Memory leak: GValue not unset on error path** (`gstd_state.c`)
  - Added `g_value_unset()` before early return in `gstd_state_update()`
  - Prevents leak when state deserialization fails

- **Critical: Session singleton race condition** (`gstd_session.c`)
  - Replaced weak pointer with `GWeakRef` for thread-safe singleton pattern
  - Fixed race where `g_object_ref()` could be called on finalizing object
  - Moved singleton logic from GObject constructor to `gstd_session_new()`

- **Bug: No-arg actions broken in parser** (`gstd_parser.c`)
  - `action_emit` passed unvalidated NULL `tokens[3]` to URI builder
  - Actions without arguments now work correctly

- **Memory leak: soup_message_body_flatten buffer not freed** (`gstd_http.c`)
  - `parse_json_body()` leaked the SoupBuffer/GBytes returned by flatten
  - Now properly frees buffer on all exit paths for both libsoup 2.x and 3.x

- **Bug: GValue unset on uninitialized values** (`gstd_action.c`)
  - Cleanup loop could call `g_value_unset()` on uninitialized GValues
  - Now tracks actual initialized count to prevent GLib criticals

- **Bug: Extra action arguments silently merged** (`gstd_action.c`)
  - `g_strsplit(..., query.n_params)` hid extra arguments in last token
  - Now splits with no limit and properly validates argument count

- **Memory leak: g_value_unset not called** (`gstd_property_flags.c`)
  - `g_value_init()` was called but `g_value_unset()` was never called before return
  - Prevents memory leak on every flags property update in long-running daemons

- **Memory leak: g_inet_address_to_string not freed** (`gstd_socket.c`)
  - Address string leaked on each client connection
  - Now properly freed after use

### Improved
- **Logging for unhandled bus message types** (`gstd_bus_msg.c`)
  - Added GST_DEBUG logging for message types without specialized handlers
  - Helps diagnose missing message handling in production (enable with `GST_DEBUG=gstd*:5`)

### Tests
- Added `test_gstd_refcount.c` with new thread safety tests:
  - `test_concurrent_state_changes` - Tests state changes from multiple threads
  - `test_invalid_state_no_leak` - Tests GValue cleanup on invalid state
  - `test_pipeline_refcount_balance` - Tests play/stop refcount cycles
  - `test_session_singleton` - Tests singleton pattern behavior
  - `test_concurrent_session_access` - Tests concurrent session creation/destruction

- Added `test_gstd_parser.c` with command parser tests (17 tests):
  - Pipeline lifecycle: `pipeline_create`, `pipeline_delete`, `pipeline_play`, `pipeline_pause`, `pipeline_stop`
  - Query commands: `list_pipelines`, `read`, `list_elements`
  - Element property: `element_get`, `element_set`
  - Events: `event_eos`
  - Error handling: Invalid commands, NULL commands, invalid pipeline descriptions, missing arguments

## [0.16.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- New `/pipelines/status` fast-path endpoint for lightweight pipeline monitoring
  - Bypasses thread pool to avoid contention during frequent polling
  - Returns only pipeline names and states for minimal overhead
  - Documented in OpenAPI specification

- **File descriptor exhaustion** (`gstd_socket.c`)
  - Added `g_io_stream_close()` to properly close socket connections
  - Prevents running out of file descriptors under sustained load

- **Double-free risk in socket stop** (`gstd_socket.c`)
  - Set `self->service = NULL` before cleanup to prevent double-free

- **NULL pointer dereference in HTTP stop** (`gstd_http.c`)
  - Removed invalid session reference that could crash during shutdown

- **Memory allocation safety** (`gstd_http.c`)
  - Changed `malloc()` to `g_new0()` for GLib consistency and zero-initialization

### GStreamer Handling Fixes

  - Added resync counter with 10-attempt limit to prevent infinite loops
  - Protects against dynamic pipeline modifications during iteration
  - Added debug logging for resync events

- **Race condition: Zero timeout in state query** (`gstd_state.c`)
  - Changed from 0ns (no wait) to 100ms timeout for state queries

  - Helps diagnose port conflicts and configuration issues

- **HTTP address validation logging** (`gstd_http.c`)

### Changed
- Default `max_threads` changed from `-1` (unlimited) to `16` for both HTTP and TCP
  - Prevents thread exhaustion under heavy load
  - Configurable via `--http-max-threads` and `--tcp-max-threads` options

### Security
